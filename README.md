  + Classifying Dog Breeds Using Convolutional Neural Networks
    + "A convolutional neural network is a type of neural network whose architecture can turn images into training data and learn from them.  In this case, pictures of dogs and humans are learned and the trained neural network can tell the difference between them and even tell you what breed of dog is in the image."
  
  + Overview
    + This is project code and report documentation
